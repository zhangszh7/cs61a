# Chapter 1.6 Higher-Order Functions

Functions that  manipulate functions are called higher-order functions.

## 1. functions as arguments

- it's just a bound name. 

## 2. functions as general methods

## 3. nested definitions of functions

- lexical scope: locally defined functions*(closures)* also have access to the name bindings in the scope in which they are defined.
- extended environment

## 4. functions as returned values

- Newton's method: to solve an equation, find the zero points.
- curring: use higher-order functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. 
  
## 5. lambda functions

- no intrinsic name
- lambda calculus

## 6. abstractions and first-class functions

- first-class: be bound to names, be passed as an argument, be returned, be included in a data structure.

## 7. function decorators

- decorators

# Lecture 4 & QA

when you have finished the code, taking some time to think about the space for simplifying or improving the implementiong of the underlying logic.
- control expressions: and, or, not; make good use of `short-circuitint`.
- conditional expressions
